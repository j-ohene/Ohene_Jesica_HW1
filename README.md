it add# week-3-
this is my first solo repository
i am from Mississauga and i like to vlog my concert and restaurant expriences on my tiktok account
I graduated with a health degree and since I had no plans to continue with a masters degree, i decided the IDP3 program would be the best way for me to acquire new skills in a creative field. 
I hope to build on skills i currently have in adobe applications such as photoshop and illustrator
