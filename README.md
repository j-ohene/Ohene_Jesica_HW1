it add# week-3-
I recently graduated from York university with a degree in kinesiology however i realized late in m degree it was not for me. 
Since i had no plan of what to do following my degree, and i lacked any skills beyond the theoretical parts of what i studied i decided I wanted to build upon my existing skills in design.
i have had previous experience working on adobe software and i thought the IDP3 program at fanshawe would be a good place to start.
